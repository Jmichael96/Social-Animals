## About

Social Animals is a part social networking/part search service for animal lovers.  Through the app, users can share images and post about animals as well as search for animal resources. This application aims to help reduce the amount of animals that are abandoned or surrendered by providing a support network of reliable sources and animal related information.

## Using the App

To get started, users will first need to create an account. From there, they can create a unique profile and start posting! Included on the home page is a search feature where users can look for pet related services and products. This is a feature that is open to all users and is not limited to just account holders.

## Future Verions

In future versions we plan to implement direct messaging, as well as integrate the Google Maps Place API to display more detailed serach information. We also would like to incorporate shelter information to make animal adoptions more accessible.
